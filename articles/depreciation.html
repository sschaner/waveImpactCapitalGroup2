          Understanding Depreciation and Cost Segregation

        </div>

        <p>
          Real estate is often chosen by investors for its tax benefits. United
          States tax law provides certain tax strategies that shelters taxable
          income, reducing tax liability. This is done through cost segregation
          that separates components of a property into different depreciation
          categories, allowing some to be realized at an accelerated rate.
        </p>

        <div class="paragraph-title">Depreciation</div>
        <p>
          Taking a deduction to recognize the decrease in value of an asset over
          time caused by its use, wear, and tear. Most real estate uses
          straight-line depreciation, which takes the entire value of the asset
          and reduces it evenly over a certain period of time. This time period
          is 27.5 years for residential property and 39 years for commercial
          property. Multifamily complexes jump between being classified as
          commercial or residential, depending on the business process taking
          place. When looking to purchase or sell a multifamily property over 4
          units, then the property is considered part of commercial real estate.
          For depreciation purposes, the tax code labels multifamily properties
          as residential, so a 27.5 year depreciation timeline would be used if
          the straight-line method was chosen for tax purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, depreciation can be accelerated or bonus depreciation used
          when cost segregation is applied.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-title">Cost Segregation</div>
        <p>
          A cost segregation study or segregation analysis can be completed on a
          property to separate the elements of the property into different
          groups that more closely represents the true lifespan of the element.
          These groups shorten some of the interior and exterior components of
          the property into 5, 7 or 15 year depreciation times, rather than the
          full 27.5 years. This enables the property owner to write off some of
          the depreciation at an accelerated rate, which reduces taxable income
          while increasing the business’s cash flow and profitability.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cost segregation study that produces a formal analysis report should
          be completed by a professional with experience in engineering,
          architecture, construction, and tax accounting. Every item that is
          connected to the property or part of its structure will be separated
          into the 5, 7, 15 or 27.5 year recovery period, this is the number of
          years over which the depreciation cost can be spread.
        </p>
        <p>
          These studies can cost thousands of dollars to complete. Generally,
          only commercial real estate investors and rental property owners with
          many properties, who can benefit from a reduction in their significant
          taxable income, will have studies done. Most companies that perform
          the cost segregation studies offer a quick analysis to determine if
          the tax savings will be significant enough to pursue a full study. For
          the maximum tax benefits, it is best to have a cost segregation study
          done within the first year following the purchase, remodel or
          construction of a large property.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-title">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</div>
        <p>
          Several new tax code sections, including 179, were added with the Tax
          Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that went into effect in 2018. The largest
          change made is that businesses can take 100% bonus depreciation in the
          first year on qualified assets instead of spreading the depreciation
          over several years. This 100% bonus depreciation is available on
          properties purchased between January 1, 2018 and January 1, 2023.
          After that, the bonus depreciation begins to phase out until it is
          completely gone in 2027.

          Depreciation and Multifamily Syndication
        </div>
        <p>
          Depending on the property, a cost segregation study and utilizing
          bonus depreciation can generate tens of thousands or even hundreds of
          thousands in tax savings. Large multifamily complexes are the ideal
          property type to perform cost segregation studies on. Wave Impact
          Capital Group utilizes this benefit by allowing all who invest in our
          properties to enjoy the paper losses while money flows into their
          pocket.
