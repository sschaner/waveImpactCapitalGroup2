          Multifamily is a Stable Asset in Any Economy
        </h1>
        <div class="article__info">
          <div class="article__author">Gynell Schaner</div>
          <div class="article__date">July 2020</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          There are many reasons I believe multifamily complexes are the safest
          real estate asset to invest in. There is recorded data through
          recessions and depressions, including a recession brought on by a real
          estate crash in 2008-2010, that supports this belief. Shelter is a
          basic necessity. Along with food and water, we need it to survive.
          This true need is only part of the driving force that makes
          multifamily a great investment.
        </p>

        <div class="paragraph-title">Demand</div>
        <p>
          According to the U.S. Census, the absorption rate for apartments,
          which means how quickly new units are rented, is at the highest it has
          been in the past 3 years. One of the leading causes of this demand is
          the cost to own or rent a single family residence. According to FRED,
          Federal Reserve Economic Data, the median home price for the United
          States in Q1 of 2020 was $327,100. With homes in coastal regions
          nearing averages of $1.2 million. This is out of reach for many
          individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the largest contributors to demand for multifamily housing are
          <span class="bold">Demographic Trends</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The 18-34 year old range is the largest generational demographic group
          and they are choosing to remain renters. This generation is often
          beginning life with too much debt to qualify for mortgages. Student
          loans are large for many people in their twenties and even thirties.
          While car loans and credit card debt also plague this generation,
          suspected to be fueled by growing up with the instant gratification of
          the digital world and the need to “keep up with the Jones’” on social
          media.
        </p>
        <p>
          The retiring baby boomers are beginning to down size. Surprisingly,
          many of them are choosing to rent, pushing demand even farther.
          Immigration, which will account for about half of the U.S. population
          growth in 2020, also increases demand for rental units. Other trends
          that create high rental demand are the increasing age at which people
          are getting married and having children, both of these life events are
          often closely aligned with purchasing a residence. The natural
          migration of people, especially when a major employer moves to a new
          market. The nation is already experiencing large movement of people,
          with more expected, due to the Covid-19 crisis. Most natural
          migrations happen at a slower rate, giving investors of multifamily
          time to adjust their portfolios to markets of expansion.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-title">Supply</div>
        <p>
          Around most of the country there are waiting lists for affordable,
          workforce housing. This is the housing that many of the teachers,
          firefighters, police, and medical support staff live in. This type of
          housing is slightly older, nice, but doesn’t have top of the line
          finishes and amenities. The number of units being built in most areas
          of the country are less than the number of people moving to those
          areas. There is not enough housing supply to meet the demand. This is
          true in all but three markets in the United States as of early 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, the scheduled construction of new housing units, of all
          types, will not meet the needed number of housing for much of the
          country. With supply not reaching the demand needed, vacancy rates
          remain low. As long as the properties in your portfolio provide
          quality living environments, the ability to attract quality residents
          should remain stable.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-title">Underwriting</div>
        <p>
          This term is used to describe the evaluation of the financial and
          physical condition of the property to determine if it meets your
          investment goals and is a sound deal to purchase. Laws regulating loan
          requirements in underwriting were made stricter after the housing
          crisis in the late 2000s and have remained so. This prevents banks
          from over leveraging on properties or loaning on junk properties,
          which were the main causes of the financial crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the Covid-19 crisis, the two largest providers of multifamily
          purchase loans, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have added even more
          requirements that may be here to stay. Depending on the loan amount
          and the loan-to-value ratio, large reserve accounts must be held by
          the lender that can cover the mortgage payments for the next 12 to 18
          months.This further secures the property and creates a cushion of
          protection against unforeseeable events that cause a downturn in the
          market that could have an effect on the properties returns.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-title">Interest Rates</div>
        <p>
          The FED has lowered interest rates to near 0% and anticipates the
          rates staying very low until at least 2022. This allows business to
          remain steady without the uncertainty of volatile interest rates that
          have been experienced in the past. Stability enables deal organizers
          to more accurately project what returns and property sale prices may
          be and structure a deal to provide the best returns to all involved.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-title">Barriers to Entry</div>
        <p>
          It is very challenging to purchase large multifamily properties.
          Qualifying for the debt to purchase these buildings along with raising
          or having the funds for the down payment, closing costs and
          renovation/maintenance cost, greatly limits the number of people
          willing to put in the time and energy needed to enter this market
          class. It is also very challenging to build new apartment complexes
          due to zoning and other local government road blocks. The amount of
          knowledge, time, and experience needed to successfully manage a
          syndication further reduces the number of people willing to remain in
          the business. All this leaves those who are well seasoned, or those
          partnered and coached by the well seasoned, to dominate this business.
          The more experience, or team with experience, one has the higher the
          likelihood of the ability to navigate through tough times.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-title">Stable Cap Rates</div>
        <p>
          All of the elements of multifamily listed above keep the prices and
          values of quality properties in stable markets steadily appreciating,
          even through downturns in the country's economy. When this happens it
          allows the assets to have positive exchanges when sales take place.
          Care will always need to be taken when making an investment to ensure
          that the property is in a location and is of a type that is within
          your managing knowledge and matches your investment goals. When
          considering real estate, as a whole multifamily remains the class
          delivering consistent demand, appreciation and returns.
