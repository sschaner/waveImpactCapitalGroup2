        <p>
          The United States has dozens of brokerage firms but there are 4 major
          firms that stand out due to number of clients and amount in assets:
          Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments, E*TRADE, and TD Ameritrade.
          Between these 4 companies is tens of trillions in assets, meaning your
          money, held in tens of millions of different accounts. The following
          will dive into some of the details of these four, and other, brokerage
          firms.
        </p>

        <div class="paragraph-title">Stock Market Returns</div>
        <p>
          When you hear that the average historical stock market return over
          time is 10%, that is true. However, that percentage is very deceiving
          because it does not account for several factors and will not be the
          return you actually realize. The 10% number comes from the historical
          average of the S&P 500, which is an index that measures the 500
          largest American publicly traded companies. These are companies that
          are large, established, and stable companies whose stock is a “safe”
          investment. Riskier stocks may or may not yield the same return.
        </p>
        <p>
          This 10% is the return before adjusting for inflation. Average
          inflation rate from 1920 through June 2020 is 2.59% with the most
          recent 30 years average inflation rate reaching 3.22%. To be on the
          conservative side, which is always wise when planning money and the
          future, use a 3% inflation rate when considering your returns. The 10%
          average return, when adjusted for inflation, becomes 7%.
        </p>
        <p>
          By many peoples standards, 7% is not a bad return. But, we have not
          yet reached the return you will actually realize. From that 7% return,
          fees will be deducted and taxes will be paid before you pocket the
          profits of your investment. Both of these topics are covered in more
          depth below. Once fees and taxes are subtracted from the return
          percentage, stock returns tend to fall below 4%. A $1,000 investment
          will produce a $40 annual return. That is in a good, rising stock
          market year. Will gains like that get you the retirement you desire?
        </p>

        <div class="paragraph-title">Compare to Multifamily Syndication</div>
        <p>
          Multifamily syndication investments are usually structured with an
          annual preferred return and a remaining equity split. The preferred
          return means that the investors get paid a percentage, often 8%, of
          the profits first. The general partners, the individuals who put the
          deal together, do not receive any profit until the investors are paid
          their preferred return amount. Any profit that remains after the
          preferred return is distributed to the investors is split between the
          investors and the general partners. This split is usually in favor of
          the investors as 60/40 or 70/30. Annual double digit returns, that you
          get to pocket, from multifamily syndication investments are
          commonplace.
        </p>

        <div class="paragraph-title">Brokerage Firm Fees</div>
        <p>
          Brokerage firms can be divided into three categories; full-service,
          discount, and online. Full-service brokerage firms often include
          products and services ranging from estate planning, tax consultation
          and preparation, and in-person or phone consultations to many other
          financial services. All this comes with large fees. The commissions,
          recurring, and annual maintenance fees alone at these firms can reach
          over 4% (Ganti).
        </p>
        <p>
          Other fees commonly charged by brokerage firms are subscriptions to
          premium research and investing data, trading platform access fees,
          inactivity fees, fees when you buy or sell a mutual fund, expense
          ratios, transaction fee, sales loads, management and advisory fees,
          and 401(K) fees. Often you have to dig deep in the fine print to
          locate information about and numbers for these fees.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fee percentages charged get smaller as the amount you invest gets
          larger. Unless you are opening accounts with $250,000 minimums, you
          will be charged the higher fees. When the numbers are in the
          trillions, billions, and millions, as the four main brokerage firms
          handle, the percentages of fees can be very small and still equal
          billions and millions in profits for the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if the fees are small, they can still add up over time and
          greatly reduce the value of your portfolio. The following is an
          example of the impact fees can have, taken from the article,
          “Understanding Investment Fees: From Brokerage Fees to Sales Loads.”
          The link for this article can be found below in the Further Your
          Education section.
        </p>
        <p>
          An investor puts $500 a month into a brokerage account for 30 years,
          depositing a total of $180,000 over that time and earning an average
          annual 7% return.
        </p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Total Annual Investment Fees</th>
            <th>Account Value After 30 Years</th>
            <th>Amount Lost to Fees</th>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1.0%</td>
            <td>$489,628.12</td>
            <td>$98,404.65</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1.5%</td>
            <td>$447,454.73</td>
            <td>$140,578.04</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2.0%</td>
            <td>$409,348.84</td>
            <td>$178,683.93</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
          As you can see, even a 2% fee has a significant impact on the value of
          the portfolio after 30 years. When you add all the fees charged by
          most brokerage firms to get the total in fees you are actually paying,
          they often far exceed 2%.
        </p>

        <div class="paragraph-title">Compare to Multifamily Syndication</div>
        <p>
          With multifamily syndication, there are two common fees charged; a one
          time acquisition fee, 1-5% of the purchase price, and an asset
          management fee, 1-3% of the monthly revenue collected. Two other fees
          that you may see, but aren’t very common, are a refinancing fee of
          0-1% of the loan amount and a disposition/sale fee that is 0-1% of the
          sale price. Even more rare is a guarantor fee, a small percentage of
          the purchase price. Any fees beyond those are very rare and I would
          question why they exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wave Impact Capital Group only charges the two most common fees. A
          1.5% one time acquisition fee that is paid to the general partners at
          the time of purchase closing. This amount is part of the money raised
          during the capital raise from investors to close the deal. This is
          paid as a reimbursement to the general partners at closing for the
          time, energy and capital required to acquire the investment
          opportunity. A 1% monthly asset management fee is part of the expenses
          of the property and paid to the general partners for maintaining the
          quality and function of the asset. There are no fees taken out of the
          preferred return distributed to investors or taken from the remaining
          profit split.
        </p>

        <div class="paragraph-title">Taxes on Stocks</div>
        <p>
          Whenever a stock is sold for a profit, even if that profit is not
          removed from your brokerage account to use in daily life but remains
          in the account for more stocks to be purchased with it, then capital
          gains taxes are owed on that profit. You personally don’t realize a
          gain until you sell and withdraw the money from your account, but the
          government realizes a gain anytime you sell at a profit. Accounts held
          in a 401(K) are exempt from the taxes owed until you withdraw the
          money, which is why there are required withdrawals form these
          retirement accounts - the government wants to be paid.
        </p>
        <p>
          The amount of tax owed depends on the length of time you held the
          stock for. If you sell the stock within a year of purchasing it, then
          the profit is taxed as a short-term capital gain at your usual tax
          rate. In other words, the profit from a stock held for one year or
          less is taxed as ordinary income. Holding the stock for over a year
          results in a long-term capital gain tax on any profit. This can be
          taxed at 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on your filing status and income
          level. In most cases, less tax will be owed if the stock was held for
          longer than one year.
        </p>

        <div class="paragraph-title">Compare to Multifamily Syndication</div>
        <p>
          The tax code encourages investment in real estate with large tax
          benefits. The profit from the sale of investment real estate is taxed
          as a capital gain, however, the tax code has a way to defer that tax
          owed by utilizing Section 1031. This tax code provision allows the
          profit from the sale of one property to be used to purchase another
          investment real estate property without owing taxes. There are time
          requirements, added legal cost, and paperwork but the final result is
          a tax savings that can reach into the hundreds of thousand of dollars.
          The 1031 Exchange method can be used repeatedly to continue deferring
          the tax liability on real estate investment properties. Then when the
          owner of the investment property dies, assuming trusts and other legal
          documents are properly in place, the heirs that inherit the property
          have the taxes forgiven. If done properly, there will never be capital
          gains tax owed on a multifamily syndication.
        </p>
        <p>
          To learn how multifamily syndication investing can offset your annual
          income and reduce your tax liability, read the articles about
          <a href="depreciation.html">Depreciation and Cost Segregation</a>
          found on the Wave Impact website.

        <div class="paragraph-title">Stock Market Risk</div>
        <p>
          All types of investments come with different risks and levels of that
          risk. The risks found with stocks are market risk - the decline in
          value of the investment due to economic events, liquidity risk - being
          able to sell at a fair price and get your money back, inflation risk -
          the loss of purchasing power because the investment does not keep up
          with inflation, and horizon risk - having to sell in a down market due
          to an unforeseen event. While it can be tracked how the economy
          influences the stock market, it is harder to show that emotion plays a
          key role in stock valuation.
        </p>
        <p>
          No one can control or predict the future of the economy, a single
          company, or someone, let alone masses of people's emotions. At best,
          we can use historical data and measure past behavior. If you view the
          lists put out by financial experts on ‘the top stocks to buy next
          year’ or ‘the mutual funds that will perform best next year,’ every
          list is different. One of the lists will end up mostly true but does
          that show knowledge of the expert that can be repeated year after year
          or does it represent statistical chance?
        </p>

          History has shown us that the best way to reduce risk in the stock
          market is to buy a diverse group of funds when the market is low, hold
          them long term for at least 10 years, and sell when the market is
          high. Is the current market at its low and should you buy now or will
          it go lower tomorrow, or next week? No one knows. The same questions
          arise when it comes time to sell. Will the market continue to rise
          next month or do I sell today? And diversify. Why? Because if you buy
          a little of it all, then when that fund goes down hopefully this one
          will go up and you will break even in the end. Quality financial
          advisors are paid millions and this is still the best advice they can
          give us.

        <div class="paragraph-title">Compare to Multifamily Syndication</div>
        <p>
          The real estate market goes through 4 cycles, expansion - when most
          growth happens, equilibrium - a time of slowing and stabilization,
          decline - when values drop, and absorption - where values begin to
          increase and recovery begins, but this growth is slow. This is similar
          to the cycles of the stock market, with a large difference. While
          there is no knowledge of how long the real estate market will be in
          each phase, the transition from phase to phase happens very slowly
          with plenty of time to react in the best interest of your portfolio
          and investment plan. Transitions between the rise and fall of the
          stock market can happen in a matter of hours or even minutes, leaving
          little time for investment corrections.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of the lack of timing control in the stock market, there is no
          control over the individual investment in stock. You have no control
          over the company or the decisions that may have influence on the stock
          value. Before you even buy multifamily real estate, you know what the
          revenue and expenses are for that property and how they can be
          adjusted, within that market's limitations, to create the most profit.
          In real estate, risk is greatly reduced by knowing and understanding
          the financial numbers while maintaining a large contingency fund in
          case of an unforeseen disaster, such as a fire.

        <div class="paragraph-title">Brokerage Firms are a Business</div>
        <p>
          What is the number one goal of any business? To make a profit for its
          owners. As an account holder at a brokerage firm, you are a client of
          that business. Meaning you are one of the individuals helping that
          company generate its profit. 3 of the top 4 brokerage firms mentioned
          at the beginning of this article generate multi billions in annual
          profits with the remaining firm nearing the billion dollar profit
          mark. This profit does not decrease in a down market when your
          portfolio remains steady or even declines in value. You are still
          paying to be their client, therefore generating a profit for them.
        </p>

        <div class="paragraph-title">Compare to Mutifamly Syndiation</div>
        <p>
          With multifamily syndication, as an investor you become an equity
          partner in the LLC of the investment property. You are not a client
          contributing to the profit for the owner. You become a part owner in
          the investment and, as such, you get paid a portion of the profits.
