          <div class="article__author">Gynell Schaner</div>
          <div class="article__date">July 2020</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          News media and social media often create drama from small events that
          have little bases in true numbers. The reports that followed the small
          rent strike groups and proposed that no one was going to make their
          rent payments on the 1st of the month are one of these covered events
          that we have seen repeatedly for April, May, June and July. Now as
          eviction bans are nearing their end, politicians and news media are
          warning of the “eviction tsunami” that is about to take place.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following data summarizes actual numbers as collected by the
          National Multifamily Housing Council’s Rent Payment Tracker, which
          collects numbers from five technology firms whose software is used
          nationally by professional property management companies. More than 11
          million market rent apartment units are represented in this data.
        </p>

        <div class="paragraph-title">Rent Collections</div>
        <p>
          87.6% of rents have been collected as of July 13, 2020. This has
          decreased slightly from one year ago when 90.1% of rent obligations
          were collected by July 13, 2019. But, it remains in line with the
          collections of the prior three months, 85.0% in April, 87.7% in May,
          and 89.0% in June.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many argue that collections will decrease as the enhanced unemployment
          benefit is scheduled to conclude at the end of this month. However,
          that additional financial benefit provided more monthly income, to
          many receiving it, than they were earning in their previous
          employment. This should allow another few months of essentials, like
          housing, to be planned for. Let’s also take into account the first
          stimulus check that would have covered rent for a month or two, if not
          more, on its own. At this point we are almost certain that another
          stimulus check will also be distributed, though details of how much
          and to whom are not yet decided.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through communications with many multifamily syndicators over the past
          4 months, I have found these numbers to be lower than they are
          observing at their properties. They are also consistently stating that
          very few people are coming forward to report needing assistance with
          rent dues. All have gone to great lengths to inform their residents of
          local, state, and federal programs that can assist them if they need
          and that they are willing to work one-on-one with residents in
          financial hardship. The holding of mainly B class assets of these
          syndicators may be the reason for the above reported numbers seen by
          my contacts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data is showing that different classes of multifamily complexes are
          experiencing different levels of rent collection. For July’s
          collections, as of July 13, 90.1% of rent dues were collected from A
          class properties, and 89.8% from class B assets. Class C properties,
          that tend to house more hourly workers who have been the hardest hit
          financially by the corona virus crisis than class A or B, collected
          the least amount of rent income at 82.7%. Collections for class C did
          decrease at a larger rate in July than was seen in previous months
          when compared to last year's collections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Location of the property also plays a role in the percentage of rent
          collected. Some areas of the country have seen higher defaults on rent
          than others. As of mid July, most of these locations are found in
          major markets with high populations. So far the news media's portrayal
          of countless households unable to pay rent has statistically not come
          to pass. But, our country has many months before the effects of
          Covid-19 are lessened for the economy and financial well being of the
          citizens. Time will tell.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-title">Evictions</div>
        <p>
          Many of the numbers used to claim an “eviction tsunami” is about to
          take place leaving millions homeless, have been taken out of context
          or not compared to actual data. An example of this is the commonly
          used Aspen Institute study that predicts 19 to 23 million renter
          households will be evicted by September 2020. These numbers are based
          on an unemployment rate of 25-30%. Actually unemployment in June was
          11.1% and trending downward. This prediction also fails to take into
          account dual income households which would further reduce the
          likelihood of missing rent owed leading to eviction.
        </p>
        <p>
          A federal study of the late 2000s crisis found that a one point
          increase in unemployment caused an increase in approximately 21,500
          people into homelessness. When you look at the difference in
          unemployment from February to June, this could add up to nearly
          165,000 people becoming homeless. That is many, but not the millions
          doomsayers are presenting.
        </p>
        <p>Other evidences against an “eviction tsunami” are:</p>
        <p>
          One of the main causes of eviction is failing to pay rent. As stated
          above, rent is being collected at near normal levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          The federal government, with the CARES Act, was not the only
          governance providing assistance to troubled renters. Most states and
          local governments stepped up with large programs of their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          While national halts on evictions are set to lift at the end of July,
          many states and local governments have also put restrictions on
          evictions that have not reached their expiration time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The local court systems that process evictions are, for the most part,
          not functioning at full capacity yet. Also, many have stated
          reluctance in progressing with evictions due to Covid-19.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two largest lenders for multifamily
          mortgages, though covered under the CARES Act, have offered distressed
          property owners options regarding their mortgage payments. The
          majority of owners taking advantage of these are those with small
          balances on smaller unit properties whose absence of even a single
          rent revenue can cause financial trouble for the property.
        </p>
        <p>
          Property owners and property managers are offering flexible payment
          plans for those having trouble paying rent. These plans were almost
          non-existent at the first of the year and are now commonplace to be
          used if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most property owners do not want to evict right now and are not even
          if they are able to. In the seven cities that are continued allowing
          evictions, six of them are trending downward in the number of
          evictions taking place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the US economy and citizens are better off than the news
          media is portraying. Guard your mind from the drama they hype up to
          entertain you and boost their ratings.
