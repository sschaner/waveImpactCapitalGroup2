            What does multifamily syndication mean and why would I choose to invest in a multifamily syndication?
          </div>
          <p>
            Multifamily syndication is to form a group of people to purchase an
            apartment complex together.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Multifamily Syndication allows investors to participate
            in an otherwise unobtainable real estate investment opportunities by
            combining capital and experience through teaming up with other
            like-minded investors. This also allows you to reduce the investment
            risk by dispersing it among all the investors and to diversify your
            capital into other real estate or in other economic sectors. See the
            Benefits of Multifamily Investing video on the Wave Impact website
            for more information.

            Is making real estate loans a safe investment?
          </div>
          <p>
            Apply common sense. Wave Impact / the closing agent / SEC and real
            estate attorney’s will make sure all paperwork is properly
            completed. As an investor, you should monthly or quarterly review
            the documents of your investment to know that it is being managed
            well so your interest and principal are protected. Wave Impact makes
            this possible with our monthly updates and quarterly reports. Real
            estate can be risky but for high risk there can be high yields. Wave
            Impact will take every precaution to reduce as much risk as possible
            throughout the entire purchase, hold and sale of the property. One
            of the most important precautions Wave Impact implements is to not
            over leverage a property. There is at least a 20% cushion, where if
            something does go wrong the property can be sold with the high
            likelihood of principal and interest being fully paid.
          </p>

        <li id="qa-3" class="answer">
          <div class="paragraph-title">
            Why is multifamily safer than single family in a recession?
          </div>
          <p>
            The biggest difference between single family and multifamily is the
            way it is valued. Single family is valued by the comp next door.
            Multifamily (5 units and above) is a business valued primarily by
            its Net Operating Income (NOI). Through physical and operational
            improvements, you can increase the value of the property by
            increasing NOI.
          </p>
          <p>
            Demand is strong for multifamily. By 2030 over 4.6 million new
            multifamily units are needed. The census bureau shows that nearly a
            third of US households rent their primary residence. This has
            remained steady for almost two decades. The student loans and car
            loans that many young people have, make them ineligible for a home
            loan. Some people will never be able to afford a home, but they need
            a place to live. When income is tight and people can’t pay the
            mortgage and the taxes on their single family home, they move back
            into an apartment. Some people choose apartments for convenience -
            no maintenance, often with many amenities and conveniences.
          </p>

        <li id="qa-4" class="answer">
          <div class="paragraph-title">Is my money secured?</div>
          <p>
            We all know real estate can be risky but Wave Impact has your money
            backed by a promissory note, mortgage-which is a lien on the
            property, lender title insurance, and hazard insurance just like the
            bank did with your personal residence when you bought it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each syndication purchases the multifamily asset through a limited
            liability company (LLC). An LLC provides its members with certain
            personal legal protections against lawsuits and personal financial
            liability. Consult with your attorney, CPA and financial advisor for
            specific advice on the benefits of investing through a multifamily
            syndication.

        <li id="qa-5" class="answer">
          <div class="paragraph-title">
            Are real estate private loans FDIC insured?
          </div>
          <p>
            Bank CD’s are FDIC insured because the government has the taxpayers
            to back them. Wave Impact can not demand an increase in taxes to pay
            your interest and principal back. Therefore, real estate investing
            and Wave Impact's Private Lender Program is NOT FDIC insured but the
            loan is secured by the real estate.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li id="qa-6" class="answer">
          <div class="paragraph-title">
            How is multifamily syndication not officially a security offering?
          </div>
          <p>
            A security is when someone gives you money that you manage for them
            in some form and you promise them a return. When that money is
            backed by using some form of physical collateral (property you own)
            to secure the principal then it is no longer considered a security
            but simply a loan.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Washington State government website has great information
            written to the average person if you wish to have a better
            understanding of this.
          </p>
          <p>
            The SEC still has many laws that govern a multifamily syndication business. Wave Impact works with a few teams of SEC experts and attorneys to ensure that we are following the guidelines and laws.
          </p>

        <li id="qa-7" class="answer">
          <div class="paragraph-title">
            How do I know what documents I’ll need to make sure my loan is
            secured?
          </div>
          <p>
            When making any major decision you seek advice from a professional,
            like our closing agent / attorneys, and let them handle the details. There is a
            list of items that must be in place before the funds are
            distributed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first thing the investor should get from the borrower (Wave
            Impact) is a disclosure statement. This is part of the Offer Book
            sent out on each individual property. This tells about the real
            estate investors program, how you get paid, how the money is
            secured, details of the particular investment, all the ins and outs
            of the LLC specific to the investment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, Wave Impact will get an appraisal done by a licensed
            appraiser. This will let you know the market value of the property
            and tell you if the loan exceeds the 80% loan to value we promise to
            stay under.
          </p>
          <p>
            Third is title insurance. Wave Impact always has title insurance

            Fourth is fire and damage insurance. If something happens, you want
            to know that the repairs will be made and you will get paid. Most of the time, banks will not close on a multifamily syndication if inusrance contracts do not far exceed this bare minimum of fire and damage insurance.

            You should have your original promissory note (property specific LLC lending paperwork) and a copy of the
            recorded mortgage or deed of trust. The mortgage or trust deed will get recorded and then a copy forwarded to you on, this is the job of the closing agent.

            You should never write a check out or wire funds to the borrower or
            Wave Impact Capital Group. All closings are done by a real estate
            attorney or a title company or another closing agent of some kind.
            Your funds should be made out to and go directly to the company
            closing the loan, not to the borrower. It is the closing agent's job
            to receive your funds, make sure the documents are in place to
            secure your interest just like they do every time they close a loan
            from a bank or any other lending institution. The closing agent also
            distributes funds when the property sells.

            What interest rate does Wave Impact Capital Group pay?

          <p>
            That will depend on the terms you choose. If you wish to receive
            quarterly or monthly income in the form of interest checks then you
            would get 6% annually. If you do not need the quarterly income and
            wish the principle to accrue interest without receiving the
            quarterly checks, being paid all the interest and principal at the
            time of the sale of the property, then you would get 8%. This higher
            interest rate is our way of saying thank you for allowing us to hold
            your interest money longer, to use as working capital if needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of if you decide to receive quarterly/monthly interest
            payments or let your interest accrue you will receive the 70/30
            split in additional profits.

            There is no guarantee in real estate. The formal paperwork that is
            signed by all involved in the investment and given to you is as
            close to a guarantee as there is. The deed of trust / mortgage is what
            gives the security to the private lender LLC member because it gives you a lien
            on the property. Meaning, legally that amount must be paid back to

            The interest rate is fixed for the life of the loan. You should know the minimum amount you will receive in interest payments each year.

          <p>
            With Wave Impact the investor has a choice of when they want their
            distributions. They can receive interest only payments monthly <span class="text-uppercase">or</span>
            quarterly or wait until the property sells or is refinanced to
            receive all of their interest. The principal is paid back upon the

          <p>
            Most properties that Wave Impact purchases will be cash flowing from
            the beginning. In some cases where the value-add component,
            renovations or vacancy, is higher, the investment strategy may
            require investors to accept more risk with little or no
            distributions in the beginning in exchange for a larger return
            later. This would be laid out in the information given to you when

            No fees are taken out of investors principal or interest amount.
            There is a one time acquisition fee, 1.5% of purchase price, that is
            included as part of the funds raised from investors before purchase,
            not individually charged. A monthly management fee, 1% of rent

          <p>
            Wave Impact follows performanced based pay to the owners of the
            company. The investors get paid with the profits before the general
            partners (deal organizers/owners) get paid. If Wave Impact manages
            the investment poorly, then profits will be minimal and we will be
            paid little to none. This is an incentive for the deal organizers to
            make sure the property is functioning at optimal levels so cash flow
            remains steady and strong.

          <p>
            This varies between properties but typically it will be 4 to 6 years
            for investors. Wave Impact will evaluate the market and the property
            to see if we should continue to hold the asset or sell it. If
            planning to hold the property, a refinance may take place. At the
            time of a refinance, in most cases, the investors would receive
            their principal amount and additional profits, causing their
            investment term to end.

          <p>
            If an investor needs to get out of the loan for some reason before
            the property is sold or refinanced, then all Wave Impact needs is 30
            days notice. There are no early withdrawal fees.

            There are no early withdrawal fees. You came into the investment
            knowing it would be a 4 - 6 year, or more, commitment. If you truly
            need out early, then you probably have had a life crisis happen and
            need a hashel free process for your early withdrawal. Wave Impact
            has 30 days from the withdrawal requests to return your principal
            and earned interest. We use this time to have the lawyer rewrite the
            contracts and find another lender if needed.

            Single family properties or small multifamily properties do not have
            sufficient revenue to hire full time staff. Because of this, owners
            are typically required to handle all day to day operations of the property. With the larger property size of a multifamily syndication, revenue is sufficient to hire full time staff to operate the property with oversight and direction from the syndicator. Wave Impact will manage the 3rd party property management company that was heavily vetted before joining our team but will not manage the property itself.

          <p>
            For the owners of Wave Impact - there is no tax on borrowed money,
            the interest we pay investors is tax deductible to us and the profit
            we make on the management and sale of the property is taxable income
            to us.

          <p>
            For you as the private lender - the interest Wave Impact pays you is
            considered taxable income and we will send you a K-1 for any
            interest and profit amounts earned that year. This is the same as it
            would be with your interest earned on a CD or dividends paid by

                If you don’t have the education, successful mentors, a rock star
                team and systems in place then you will most likely make
                mistakes. Mistakes are very costly in this business.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li class="qa-list-item">
                  Do you have hundreds of thousands of dollars you can lose for
                  a mistake?
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If you don’t know what you are doing in this business, a
                      mistake could cost you that much.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li class="qa-list-item">
                  Are you willing to go to jail?
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      There are many laws and regulations within this business
                      that have strong consequences if you don’t follow them.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you can not answer yes to most of these questions, then I would
            say you probably should not try to pursue this business on your own.
